## LinkedIn Project Description

### Project Title
**DMUDMS - Comprehensive Dormitory Management System**

### Project Summary
Developed a full-stack web application for Debre Markos University to streamline dormitory operations, student accommodation management, and administrative workflows. The system serves 500+ students and 50+ staff members with role-based access control and real-time management capabilities.

### Key Features & Achievements
• **Multi-Role Dashboard System**: Implemented 7 distinct user roles (Admin, Directorate, Coordinator, Proctor, Security Guard, Registrar, Student) with tailored interfaces and permissions

• **Smart Room Assignment**: Automated room allocation system with gender-based segregation, disability accessibility considerations, and capacity management

• **Exit Paper Workflow**: Digital approval system for students taking items out of dormitory - from student submission to proctor approval to security verification

• **Emergency Management**: Comprehensive emergency reporting and contact system with real-time notifications and escalation protocols

• **Profile Management**: Integrated Cloudinary for profile image uploads with automatic optimization and secure storage

• **Email Automation**: Professional email notification system for user registration, password resets, and important updates using SMTP integration

• **CSV Data Management**: Bulk import/export functionality for students and employees with validation and error handling

• **Real-time Analytics**: Dashboard statistics and reporting for occupancy rates, emergency incidents, and system usage

### Technical Implementation
